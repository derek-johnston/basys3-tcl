# Basys3 TCL Project Template

**Developed By:** Derek Johnston <br>
**Last Modified:** 11/14/2017

## Description

This repository contains an empty project template for building FPGA <br>
projects on the Basys3 Development Board without the need to <br> 
master the complex Vivado Design Suite (VDS). 

With this template, anyone should be able to add/edit/delete Verilog <br> 
HDL files using their favorite code editor (Atom, VS Code, etc.) and <br>
deploy their HDL design to the Artix-7 FPGA on the Basys3 Development <br>
Board with a single command-line instruction.

**Note:** This project still requires VDS to be installed on your system.

## Installation Guide
This guide will take you through the process of installing VDS as <br>
well as the additional custom libraries provided here.
